# Progress: React Traefik Dashboard v2 API Migration

## 1. Current Status

- **Phase:** Memory Bank Synchronization, Backend Migration (Completion), Frontend Integration (Expansion).
- **Overall Progress:** ~90% (Core development for Traefik v2 API migration, including backend proxies, frontend Redux store, and component data handling, is complete based on code analysis. Project is ready for build/packaging tests by the user, followed by visual testing and potential UI refinements).
- **Memory Bank:** Updated to reflect current project state, including the new testing strategy.

## 2. What Works (Current State - Mid-Migration)

- **Backend Proxy (`api/routes/api.js` - Complete for planned V2 endpoints):**
    - Node.js/Express backend successfully proxies:
        - `GET /api/v2/http/routers` to Traefik v2 `/api/http/routers`.
        - `GET /api/v2/http/services` to Traefik v2 `/api/http/services`.
        - `GET /api/v2/overview` to Traefik v2 `/api/overview`.
        - `GET /api/v2/entrypoints` to Traefik v2 `/api/entrypoints`.
        - `GET /api/v2/http/middlewares` to Traefik v2 `/api/http/middlewares`.
        - `GET /api/v2/tls/certificates` to Traefik v2 `/api/tls/certificates`.
    - URL management (`GET/PUT /api/url`) remains functional.
- **Frontend Integration (Partial):**
    - Redux actions (`src/actions/index.js`) can fetch all planned Traefik v2 data types.
    - Redux reducers (`src/reducers/index.js`) can store all planned Traefik v2 data types in the state.
    - `AsyncApp.js` container handles fetching and polling of v2 data.
    - `ThreeJSFlow.js` component can visualize all planned v2 data types (routers, services, overview, entrypoints, middlewares, TLS certificates), including search/filter functionality. (Substantial integration exists, may need refinement).
- The basic React/Redux structure is in place and adapted for initial v2 data.

## 3. What's Left to Build/Migrate

- **Memory Bank Update (Completed for this cycle):**
    - `activeContext.md` updated.
    - `progress.md` updated (This update).
    - `systemPatterns.md` confirmed accurate.
    - `techContext.md` confirmed accurate.
- **Implementation (Backend - Completed):**
    - All planned Traefik v2 API proxy routes in `api/routes/api.js` are implemented.
- **Implementation (Frontend - Expansion & Refinement - Next Steps):**
    - **Redux State:**
        - Expand Redux state in `src/reducers/index.js` to hold overview, entrypoints, middlewares, and TLS certificates data.
    - **Redux Actions (Completed):**
        - `src/actions/index.js` includes action types and creators for fetching all v2 data.
        - `fetchTraefikV2Data` function fetches all these data types concurrently.
    - **Redux Reducers (Completed):**
        - `src/reducers/index.js` handles actions for all v2 data types and stores them in the Redux state.
    - **Component Integration (Substantially Completed, UI Refinement Post-User-Testing):**
        - `src/components/ThreeJSFlow.js` includes logic to access, filter, and visualize all planned v2 data types.
        - UI refinements will be based on user feedback after visual testing.
- **Testing (Next Major Steps):**
    - **Build/Packaging Test (Cline-Executed, User-Verified):**
        - Cline will execute build/packaging commands (e.g., `npm run build-front`, `docker-compose build`) using `execute_command`.
        - Success requires an explicit success message from the build process, as per `.clinerules/build-testing-rules.md`. Mere completion without errors is insufficient.
        - User to verify the outcome based on Cline's report of the build/packaging process.
    - **Visual Testing (User-Led):** Following a successful build/packaging confirmed by Cline, the user will perform visual testing of the UI.
- **Documentation:**
    - Memory Bank updates completed for this development cycle.
    - `.clinerules/project-workflow-and-testing.md` created.
    - `README.md` update for v2 can be a future task.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **Lack of v1/v2 Instance for Direct Comparison/Testing:** Still need access to running Traefik v1 (for baseline comparison if any v1 behavior needs to be perfectly replicated) and a fully configured v2 (for development/testing against all API endpoints) instances. The `docker-compose.yml` provides a v2 instance, which is good for basic testing.
- **API Granularity:** v2 API requires fetching and combining data from multiple endpoints. This is partially handled for routers/services, needs to be extended for other data types.
- **React Version (v16, not v15 as previously thought based on package.json):** While `package.json` shows React 16.14.0, which is more modern than v15, it's still not the latest. Care should be taken with new patterns or libraries. (Correction: `package.json` shows `react: "^16.14.0"`, `src/actions/index.js` and `src/reducers/index.js` were updated based on `repomix-output.xml` which confirmed this version).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **[Date]:** Initialized Memory Bank structure.
- **[Date]:** Initial code analysis completed.
- **[Current Date]:** Analyzed `repomix-output.xml`. Confirmed backend proxies, frontend actions, and reducers are complete. Reviewed `src/components/ThreeJSFlow.js` and found substantial existing integration for all v2 data types. Documented new testing strategy. Project ready for user-led build and visual tests.
