# Progress: React Traefik Dashboard v2 API Migration

## 1. Current Status

- **Phase:** API Call Adjustments & Visual Component Tuning (Paused), Git Operations.
- **Overall Progress:** ~85-90% (Core API migration and backend proxy are complete. Frontend data fetching adjusted. Visual components (`ThreeJSFlow.js`, `Tree.js`) have undergone several iterations to fix errors and attempt to match original design, but further visual refinement is postponed by user. Project is ready for commit, push, and branching).
- **Memory Bank:** `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` (this file) updated to reflect current state and next steps.

## 2. What Works (Current State)

- **Backend Proxy (`api/routes/api.js` - Complete):**
    - All planned Traefik v2 API endpoints are proxied.
    - URL management (`GET/PUT /api/url`) is functional.
- **Frontend Data Handling:**
    - Redux actions (`src/actions/index.js`) now fetch all required v2 data types, excluding `/api/v2/tls/certificates` as per user feedback.
    - Redux reducers (`src/reducers/index.js`) correctly store the fetched v2 data types and manage `isFetching` state.
    - `AsyncApp.js` container handles fetching and polling of adjusted v2 data.
- **Visual Components (Partially Adjusted, Further Work Postponed):**
    - `src/components/Tree.js`: Added defensive coding to prevent `TypeError` during rendering.
    - `src/components/ThreeJSFlow.js`:
        - Logic adjusted to ensure root nodes (Traefik & Internet icons) attempt to render even with no child data.
        - Data transformation logic modified to group services under provider nodes and routers directly under the "Internet" node.
        - Standalone "Middlewares" group and "Overview" box removed from direct visualization to simplify and align closer to original design's scope.
- **Builds:**
    - Frontend (`npm run build-front` with `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`) compiles successfully.
    - Docker image (`docker-compose build`) builds successfully.

## 3. What's Left to Build/Migrate

- **Git Operations (Immediate):**
    - Stage all current changes (`git add .`).
    - Commit changes with an appropriate message (e.g., "Refactor: Adjust API calls & visual components; Prepare for appPortal branch").
    - Push current branch to remote (`git push`).
    - Create and switch to a new branch named "appPortal" (`git checkout -b appPortal`).
    - Push the new "appPortal" branch to remote and set upstream (`git push --set-upstream origin appPortal`).
- **UI Refinement (Postponed by User):**
    - Further work on `src/components/ThreeJSFlow.js` and `src/index.css` to precisely match the visual styling (node shapes, colors, detailed text placement, line styling) of the original design diagram. The current visual output still differs significantly from the target.
- **Documentation:**
    - `README.md` update for v2 can be a future task.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **Visual Discrepancy:** The current D3.js visualization in `ThreeJSFlow.js` does not yet match the original design's appearance (e.g., blue/green rectangular nodes with detailed text, specific provider icons as intermediate nodes, exact layout). This work is currently postponed.
- **Lack of v1/v2 Instance for Direct Comparison/Testing:** (Ongoing) Access to running Traefik v1 (for baseline) and a fully configured v2 (for development/testing) instances would be beneficial for precise UI replication.
- **React Version:** Project uses React 16.14.0.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **[Previous Dates]:** Initial analysis, backend proxy completion, initial frontend data integration.
- **[Current Date - Recent]:**
    - Removed `/api/v2/tls/certificates` API call from frontend based on user feedback.
    - Made several adjustments to `ThreeJSFlow.js` and `Tree.js` to address runtime errors and attempt to align visual structure with original design (e.g., provider nodes, direct router children).
    - User has decided to pause further visual refinement and proceed with Git operations and branching for "appPortal".
