# Active Context: React Traefik Dashboard v2 API Migration

## 1. Current Work Focus

- **Preparing for Git Operations:** Committing current changes, pushing to remote, and creating a new branch "appPortal" for subsequent development.
- **Memory Bank Update:** Reflecting recent code modifications and change in task direction.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **API Call Adjustments:**
    - Removed frontend API call to `/api/v2/tls/certificates` in `src/actions/index.js` based on user feedback that it's not for querying and was not in the original project design.
    - Removed related action type (`RECEIVE_TRAEFIK_TLS_CERTIFICATES`) and action creator from `src/actions/index.js`.
    - Removed `tlsCertificates` state and reducer case from `src/reducers/index.js`.
    - Updated `RECEIVE_TRAEFIK_MIDDLEWARES` reducer case in `src/reducers/index.js` to set `isFetching: false` as it's now the last expected data action.
- **Visual Component Adjustments (Attempted Fixes):**
    - Modified `src/components/Tree.js` to add defensive checks for DOM element positions to prevent `TypeError` related to `'.traefik-root'` or `'.internet-root'` not being found.
    - Modified `src/components/ThreeJSFlow.js` (`loadData` method) to:
        - Ensure root D3 nodes (`traefikSideData`, `internetSideData`) are always attempted to be rendered even if they have no children.
        - Remove the "Traefik Overview" text box from the top-left of the visualization.
        - Restructure how Routers are added to `internetSideData` (as direct children).
        - Introduce Provider nodes (e.g., Docker, File) under `traefikSideData` and group Services under their respective Providers.
        - Remove the standalone "Middlewares" group node from `traefikSideData`.
        - Optimize Router node `name` and `details` for better information display.
- **Builds:**
    - Frontend (`npm run build-front` with `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`) successfully compiled after visual component changes.
    - Docker image (`docker-compose build`) successfully built after visual component changes.
- **Task Direction Change:** User has decided to postpone further frontend visual styling fixes and proceed with Git operations and branching.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the current state.
- Execute `git add .` to stage all changes.
- Execute `git commit -m "Refactor: Adjust API calls & visual components; Prepare for appPortal branch"` (or a similar appropriate commit message).
- Execute `git push` to push current branch changes to the remote repository.
- Execute `git checkout -b appPortal` to create and switch to the new "appPortal" branch.
- Execute `git push --set-upstream origin appPortal` to push the new branch to remote and set upstream.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Memory Bank Synchronization:** Ensuring Memory Bank accurately reflects the codebase is paramount.
- **API Completeness:** The goal is to proxy and utilize all relevant Traefik v2 API endpoints as defined in `productContext.md`.
- **Frontend Data Handling:** Efficiently fetching, storing, and rendering multiple types of API data (routers, services, overview, etc.) in Redux and React components.
- **Backward Compatibility (Out of Scope):** Focus is solely on Traefik v2.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Backend Proxy:** Node.js/Express backend in `api/` acts as a simple proxy to the Traefik API. New endpoints will follow this pattern.
- **Frontend State Management:** Redux with `redux-thunk` for asynchronous actions. Data is fetched via `isomorphic-fetch`.
- **Component-Based UI:** React components in `src/components/` and `src/containers/`.
- **Visualization:** D3.js via a custom `Tree` class, integrated into the `ThreeJSFlow.js` React component.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

- **Visual Component Complexity:** The D3.js visualization in `ThreeJSFlow.js` and `Tree.js` is sensitive to the input data structure and CSS. Changes to data fetching or structure require careful corresponding adjustments in the visualization components.
- **API Endpoint Semantics:** Clarified that `/api/v2/tls/certificates` might not be intended for general querying in this project's context.
- **Build Environment:** `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` is necessary for `react-scripts build` with current Node.js version.
- **Git Repository:** Project will be pushed to `ssh://git@e4e-vcs.deltaww.com:8080/andrew-test/infra/react-traefik.git`.
