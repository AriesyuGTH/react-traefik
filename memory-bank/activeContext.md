# Active Context: React Traefik Dashboard v2 API Migration

## 1. Current Work Focus

- **Finalizing Analysis & Handover for Testing:** Concluding the analysis of the current codebase, ensuring all findings are documented, and preparing for the user to take over for build/packaging tests and subsequent visual testing.
- **Memory Bank Update:** Ensuring Memory Bank accurately reflects the latest project status and testing strategy.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Analyzed `repomix-output.xml`.
- Confirmed backend API proxies (`api/routes/api.js`) for all required Traefik v2 endpoints are implemented.
- Confirmed frontend Redux actions (`src/actions/index.js`) for fetching all v2 data types are implemented.
- Confirmed frontend Redux reducers (`src/reducers/index.js`) for storing all v2 data types in the state are implemented.
- Reviewed `src/components/ThreeJSFlow.js` and found **substantial existing integration for accessing, filtering, and visualizing all planned v2 data types** (overview, entrypoints, middlewares, TLS certificates, in addition to routers and services).
- Updated `progress.md` to reflect the advanced state of component integration, adjusting overall progress.
- Updated `activeContext.md` (this file) to reflect the current status.
- Confirmed `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` are up-to-date.
- Created `.clinerules/project-workflow-and-testing.md` to document project-specific guidelines, including the new testing strategy.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

- **Confirm Code Readiness for Build Test:** Based on analysis, the core migration logic (backend proxies, Redux store, component data handling) appears to be in place.
- **Handover to User for Testing:**
    - Cline's responsibility for this phase concludes with ensuring the conceptual completeness of the code for migration.
    - User will perform build/packaging tests (e.g., `npm run build-front`, `docker-compose build`).
    - User will then perform visual testing of the UI.
- **UI Refinement (Post-Testing by User):** Based on user's visual testing feedback, further UI refinements can be planned.
- **Code Review & Cleanup (User Discretion):** User may choose to review `ThreeJSFlow.js` for refactoring.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Memory Bank Synchronization:** Ensuring Memory Bank accurately reflects the codebase is paramount.
- **API Completeness:** The goal is to proxy and utilize all relevant Traefik v2 API endpoints as defined in `productContext.md`.
- **Frontend Data Handling:** Efficiently fetching, storing, and rendering multiple types of API data (routers, services, overview, etc.) in Redux and React components.
- **Backward Compatibility (Out of Scope):** Focus is solely on Traefik v2.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Backend Proxy:** Node.js/Express backend in `api/` acts as a simple proxy to the Traefik API. New endpoints will follow this pattern.
- **Frontend State Management:** Redux with `redux-thunk` for asynchronous actions. Data is fetched via `isomorphic-fetch`.
- **Component-Based UI:** React components in `src/components/` and `src/containers/`.
- **Visualization:** D3.js via a custom `Tree` class, integrated into the `ThreeJSFlow.js` React component.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

- **Project State Discrepancy:** Initial Memory Bank state was behind actual codebase progress, highlighting the importance of tools like `repomix-output.xml` for context recovery.
- **Backend Progress (Completed):** All planned proxy routes in `api/routes/api.js` for Traefik v2 API endpoints are implemented.
- **Frontend Progress:**
    - `src/actions/index.js`: All actions for v2 data implemented (Completed).
    - `src/reducers/index.js`: Handles all v2 data types (Completed).
    - `src/components/ThreeJSFlow.js`: Substantial integration for all v2 data types exists; primary focus is now on refinement and testing.
